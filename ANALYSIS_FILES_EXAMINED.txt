## Key Findings Summary

### Strengths of Current Approach
- Clear role definitions
- Comprehensive checklists
- Practical code examples
- Quality gates at each phase
- Parallel execution support

### Weaknesses (vs. Simon's Approach)
- Vague success criteria (subjective language)
- Implicit rather than explicit constraints
- No iterative refinement loops
- Weak ambiguity handling
- Research phase completely absent
- Failed quality gates have no recovery path

### Simon Willison's Core Techniques Applied
1. Explicit constraints upfront and measurable
2. Structured ambiguity handling (Flag → Propose → Confirm)
3. Formal success criteria with explicit rules
4. Iterative refinement loops for recovery
5. Research phase before implementation
6. Knowledge capture and learning from decisions

### Recommended Improvements

Phase 1 (Immediate - Low Effort):
- Enhance architect.md with explicit constraints
- Enhance code-reviewer.md with formalized severity rules
- Enhance test-engineer.md with explicit coverage rules
- Create ambiguity handling template

Phase 2 (Short-term):
- Add /orchestr8:research-approach workflow
- Add remediation flows to all workflows
- Create constraint templates for reuse

Phase 3 (Medium-term - Q1 2026):
- Create /agents/research/ category (5+ agents)
- Enhanced orchestrators with research phases
- Knowledge capture system

## Analysis Methodology

1. **Examined 74+ agent definition files** across all categories
2. **Analyzed 20 workflow commands** for prompt patterns
3. **Deep dive into 5-6 key agents** (architect, code-reviewer, test-engineer, etc.)
4. **Compared against Simon Willison's documented approaches:**
   - Clear objectives with specific constraints
   - Iterative refinement
   - Structured ambiguity handling
   - Research before implementation
   - Knowledge capture

5. **Identified specific weaknesses:**
   - Line-by-line examples from actual prompts
   - Showed current text vs. Simon's approach
   - Explained why Simon's approach is better

6. **Provided concrete improvements:**
   - Before/after code examples
   - Templates for new agents
   - Implementation roadmap with phases
   - Success metrics for measurement

## Next Steps

1. Review PROMPT_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md for executive overview
2. Read PROMPT_ANALYSIS_SIMON_COMPARISON.md for detailed analysis
3. Review Phase 1 improvements for immediate implementation
4. Consider Phase 2 and Phase 3 enhancements for future work
5. Track adoption metrics
